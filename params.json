{"name":"Quote Of The Day Viewer","tagline":"A GUI application that can view the quote of the day from quote of the day servers","body":"### Quote Of The Day Viewer (qotd-viewer)\r\nquotd-viewer is a GUI application that can view the quote of the day from quote of the day servers (which send plain text over port 17). You can check out the Wikipedia page on quote of the day servers [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QOTD). Qotd-viewer is written entirely in Python, and uses Tkinter for GUI stuff.\r\n\r\nHow to clone our git repository:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/iandun/qotd-viewer.git\r\n$ cd qotd-viewer\r\n```\r\nThanks to Freeze, we are able to build a UNIX application that _does not_ require python to function. See the [README file](https://github.com/iandun/qotd-viewer/blob/master/README.md) for more information.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
